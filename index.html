<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Charlotte and I am in college for <strong>Graphic Design</strong>. I grew up wanting to be a Marine Biologist but then realized that I suck at science and math. </p>

<p>I decided to go to college for Graphic Design because in highschool I took two media arts classes and realized that I was really good at it and enjoyed it. I chose Alqonquin Ottawa as the college I wanted to attend because it was an hour away from my home and the residence was really nice.</p>
